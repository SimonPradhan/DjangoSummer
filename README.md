During my Summer Class I created a django web application about blog website.

To download and use the project in your local machine. Follow the below mentioned steps:

    ```

    ```
    git clone  git@github.com:SimonPradhan/DjangoSummer.git summerproject
    ```
      
- Setup the environment
  - Go to the folder
  ```
  cd summerproject

    - You can create the virtualenv with virtualenv library or the pythonenv
      - You can click [here](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html) for the documentation to know more about the virtual environment.
